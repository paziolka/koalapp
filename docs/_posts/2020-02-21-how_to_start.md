title: How to start

### Prerequisites

- I assume you are a front-end developer and you look for an easy way to build an API to be consumed by your app. You understand basic concepts of programming e.g. data structures or variables definitions.

You have already installed:
- [rvm](https://rvm.io/) with desired version of ruby (sry, I really don't like the another version manager for ruby)
- [bundler](https://bundler.io/)

You can check the above requirements with commands:

* `rvm list` that shows all installed rubies with current and default versions
* Please 🙏 use **ruby 2.6.5** in this tutorial, otherwise unexpected things could happen
* To change the version to `2.6.5` you need to type in `rvm use 2.6.5`. If it's not installed yed, rvm will show you the proper command.
* `bundle -v` that shows installed version of bundler

I also want you to do the [Try Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/) tutorial first, to have a grasp of ruby language ideas. At the website they claim it takes 30 minutes 😉.
