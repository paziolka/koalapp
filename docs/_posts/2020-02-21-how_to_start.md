### Prerequisites

- I assume you are a front-end developer and you look for an easy way to build an API to be consumed by your app. You understand basic concepts of programming e.g. data structures or variables definitions.

You have already installed:
- [rvm](https://rvm.io/) with desired version of ruby (sry, I really don't like the another version manager for ruby)
- [bundler](https://bundler.io/)

I also want you to do the [Try Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/) tutorial first, to have a grasp of ruby language ideas. At the website they claim it takes 30 minutes ðŸ˜‰.
